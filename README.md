# ThreatSim-X -- Threat Simulation & Response Framework
Goal: Build a modular framework to simulate basic cyber/physical threats and test response workflows perfect for DevSecOps, space systems, or smart infrastructure themes.

# ðŸš€ Overview

Threat Simulation & Response Framework is a cybersecurity-oriented project designed to simulate a variety of common network-based threats and demonstrate automated detection and response logic. The goal is to model how real-world security systemsâ€”such as Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) or Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)â€”can behave in detecting and mitigating attacks.

This framework acts as a foundational, modular blueprint for understanding threat intelligence, system hardening, and incident response workflows in a controlled environment.

# ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

Simulate typical cyber attacks (brute-force, port scanning, suspicious behavior, malware indicators)

Build a modular monitoring and detection pipeline

Automate alert generation and basic response actions (e.g., block IP, notify admin)

Log incidents and create reports for analysis

Provide a playground for experimentation with threat models and response logic

# ðŸ§  Concept:

Simulate common cyber threats (e.g., brute force login attempts, port scanning, malware signatures), and trigger mock responses such as alert logging, IP blocking, or incident reporting.

triggering of modular response handlers

logging and visualization of the process

# ðŸ”¥ Key Features
Realistic Threat Simulations: Models how various cyber attacks might manifest in logs and system behavior.

Pluggable Detection Engines: Combine rule-based and anomaly-based techniques for flexibility.

Automated Response Actions: Simulated IP blocking, logging, and alerts give a sense of what real response would entail.

Human-Readable Logging: Incident reports are saved in structured JSON or plain text formats for analysis.

Easy Configurations: Thresholds and rules can be tuned via config files.

# ðŸ”§ Tools/Libraries:

Python (core language)

scapy or socket for simulating traffic

psutil or os for system interaction

sqlite3 or json for logging/responses

Optional: flask or streamlit for frontend dashboard

# ðŸ›  Technologies & Tools
Python 3.11+

socket and subprocess (for simulations)

logging for incident capture

pytest for unit tests

PyYAML for configuration

Optionally: Flask or Streamlit for a front-end dashboard (future enhancement)
