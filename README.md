# ThreatSim-X -- Threat Simulation & Response Framework
Goal: Build a modular framework to simulate basic cyber/physical threats and test response workflows perfect for DevSecOps, space systems, or smart infrastructure themes.

# ðŸš€ Overview

ThreatSim-X is a modular, Python-based framework for simulating and detecting cyber threats, triggering automated responses, and logging incidents. Ideal for cybersecurity demos in DevSecOps, smart infrastructure, or space systems contexts.

# ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

Simulate typical cyber attacks (e.g., brute-force, port scanning, malware detection)

Build a modular monitoring and detection pipeline

Automate response actions (IP blocking, alerting, logging)

Log incidents and generate reports for analysis

Provide a sandbox for experimenting with threat models and response strategies

# ðŸ”¥ Key Features

Realistic Threat Simulations: Brute force, port scanning, malware indicators

Pluggable Detection Engines: Threshold-based and signature/rule-based logic

Automated Mock Responses: Logging, IP blocking, alerting (print/email/etc.)

Human-Readable Logging: Structured logs in JSON or text format

Easy Configuration: Modify detection thresholds and rules via YAML

# âœ… Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/formertriton/ThreatSim-X.git
cd ThreatSim-X
```
2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the simulation:
```
python main.py
```
4. (Optional) Launch the dashboard:
```
streamlit run app.py
```
